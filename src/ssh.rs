#![cfg(unix)]

//! Embedded mesh SSH server (`ray firewall ssh on`), Tailscale-style.
//!
//! The daemon runs a small SSH server on each mesh IP's configured SSH port
//! (22 by default). A stock `ssh` client connecting to `<peer>.ray` (or the mesh IP)
//! lands here. There are no SSH keys: the connecting peer is already
//! cryptographically identified by the QUIC mesh link, and the kernel TCP stack
//! delivers the connection with the peer's mesh IP as the socket source (the
//! ingress anti-spoof check in [`crate::forward`] guarantees that IP is really
//! the peer's). We map that IP back to the peer identity via [`crate::peers::PeerTable`] and
//! admit the session iff the peer is in a shared network's `ssh_allow` list.
//! Grants are checked across verified memberships, not the network handles on
//! the current connection. Reconnecting through another network cannot hide a grant.
//!
//! Authorization is the only gate; SSH auth itself is the `none` method (the
//! identity is already proven). Which local accounts a peer may log in as comes
//! from its `SshRule.users` (see [`UserPolicy`]): empty grants any non-root
//! account, an explicit list grants exactly those, `*` grants any including root.
//!
//! An authorized peer gets what a stock sshd session gives it: shells, `exec`,
//! sftp (so `scp` works), forwarding in both directions (`ssh -L`, `-D`,
//! `ProxyJump`, `-R`, and the unix-socket forms of both), agent forwarding
//! (`ssh -A`), locale environment variables, and signals. X11 forwarding is the
//! one thing missing, and it is refused explicitly rather than left hanging.
//!
//! An interactive session is handed to `login(1)` where the host has one, so
//! the things a directly-spawned shell silently skips come from the system
//! instead of from us: the PAM account check (a locked or expired account is
//! refused), the PAM session (logind session, `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, resource
//! limits), the utmp/wtmp records behind `who` and `last`, `/etc/nologin` and
//! the motd. Root is the exception: `login` refuses a root session on a tty
//! outside `/etc/securetty`, and refuses it by hanging, so root (and every
//! non-interactive session, which has no login record either way) still spawns
//! the shell directly.
//!
//! Forwarding runs in the daemon, which is root, so two rules keep it from
//! being worth more than a shell on the same host. A TCP forward goes anywhere
//! the host can reach (loopback services included), exactly like a shell would.
//! A unix-socket forward is checked against the login account's own permission
//! on the socket (or on the directory it would be created in) first, because
//! there the filesystem *is* the access control and root ignores it.
//!
//! Authorization is evaluated once, when the connection is accepted, so
//! `ray firewall ssh allow/deny` changes apply to *new* sessions; an
//! already-established session is not torn down by a later `deny`.
//!
//! A connection from this host to its own mesh address never arrives here. The
//! kernel short-circuits self-traffic over loopback (see
//! [`crate::tun::route_self_loopback`]), so it never enters the TUN, and the
//! port rewrite that makes the configured mesh SSH port reach the internal listener lives in
//! that forwarding path. The connection lands on the mesh IP, where nothing
//! is bound, and the kernel refuses it. Binding `:22` as well would not fix
//! that: the `none` auth method is safe only because the mesh link proves who
//! the peer is, and a loopback connection proves nothing beyond "some account
//! on this box", so admitting it would hand every local user a root shell. On
//! the host itself, use the host sshd (`ssh localhost`), which authenticates.
